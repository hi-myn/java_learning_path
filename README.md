# 🚀 Java Exercises

Repository dedicated to simple Java projects created as exercises based on content covered in the Java course. Each project is developed, reviewed, and refined to reinforce learning.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a **project-theme** with a specific exercise. The main source code is located inside the `src` folder of each project.

```
📁 ProjectName/
├── 📁 src/          # Main source code
│   └── App.java   # Main file (or package structure)
```
