# 🚀 Java Exercises

Repository dedicated to simple Java projects created as exercises based on content covered in the Java course. Each project is developed, reviewed, and refined to reinforce learning.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a **project-theme** with a specific exercise. The main source code is located inside the `src` folder of each project.

```
📁 ProjectName/
├── 📁 src/          # Main source code
│   └── App.java   # Main file (or package structure)
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java 21** 
- VSCode

## 📌 Available Projects

1. **Multiplication Table Generator**  
   A simples Java program that generates the multiplication table (up to 10) for a use-input number.  
   📌 Key concepts: `variables`, `operators`, `user input w/ Scanner`, `formatted output`,.

2. **Student Grade Calculator**  
   A Java program that calcuates a student's average grade and determines if they passed (≥7.0) or failed..  
   📌 Key concepts: `user input (Scanner)`, `variables`, `ternary operator`, `formatted output`, `basic arithmetic`.

3. **BMI Calculator**  
   A Java program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and categorizes the result according to standard health guidelines.  
   📌 Key concepts: `user input (Scanner)`, `variables`, `arithmetic operations`, `onditional statements (if/else)`, `double precision handling`.

4. **Product Catalog Classifier**  
   A Java program that checks if a product exists in a catalog, allows price updates, and classifies products based on price range.  
   📌 Key concepts: `String comparison (equalsIgnoreCase)`, `nested conditionals`, `ternary operator`, `user input validation`, `price categorization`.

5. **Temperature Converter**  
   A Java program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales based on user selection.  
   📌 Key concepts: `modular methods`, `user-driven menu`, `mathematical conversions`, `input validation`.

6. **Letter Counter**  
   A Java program that counts letters in user-input sentences (ignoring spaces) with repeat functionality.
   📌 Key concepts: `string manipulation`, `loops (do-while)`, `modular methods`, `user input handling`.

7. **Basic Calculator**  
   A Java program that performs the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input.
   📌 Key concepts: `modular methods`, `switch statement`, `input validation`, `floating-point arithmetic`.

8. **Number Guessing Game**  
   A Java game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 0-100 with hints for incorrect attempts.
   📌 Key concepts: `random number generation`, `while loops`, `conditional logic`, `user input handling`, `attempt counter`.
