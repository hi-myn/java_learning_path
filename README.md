# 🚀 Java Exercises

Repository dedicated to simple Java projects created as exercises based on the content covered in the Java course. Each project is developed, reviewed, and refined to reinforce learning.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a **project theme** with a specific exercise. The main source code is located inside the `src` folder of each project.

```
📁 Project Name/
├── 📁 src/          # Main source code
│   └── App.java   # Main file
```

## 🛠️ Technologies used

- **Java 21**
- VSCode

## 📌 Available projects

1. **Multiplication table generator**  
   A simple Java program that generates the multiplication table (up to 10) for a number entered by the user.  
   📌 Key concepts: `variables`, `operators`, `user input with Scanner`, `formatted output`.

2. **Student grade calculator**  
   A Java program that calculates a student's average grade and determines whether they have passed (≥7.0) or failed.  
   📌 Key concepts: `user input (Scanner)`, `variables`, `ternary operator`, `formatted output`, `basic arithmetic`.

3. **BMI calculator**  
   A Java program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and categorizes the result according to standard health guidelines.  
   📌 Key concepts: `user input (Scanner)`, `variables`, `arithmetic operations`, `conditional statements (if/else)`, `double precision manipulation`.

4. **Product Catalog Classifier**  
   A Java program that checks if a product exists in a catalog, allows price updates, and classifies products based on price range.  
   📌 Key Concepts: `string comparison (equalsIgnoreCase)`, `nested conditionals`, `ternary operator`, `user input validation`, `price categorization`.

5. **Temperature Converter**  
   A Java program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales based on user selection.  
   📌 Key concepts: `modular methods`, `user-driven menu`, `mathematical conversions`, `input validation`.

6. **Letter counter**  
   A Java program that counts the letters in sentences entered by the user (ignoring spaces) with repeat functionality.
   📌 Key concepts: `string manipulation`, `loops (do-while)`, `modular methods`, `user input handling`.

7. **Basic calculator**
   A Java program that performs the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input.
   📌 Key concepts: `modular methods`, `switch statement`, `input validation`, `floating point arithmetic`.

8. **Number guessing game**  
   A Java game in which players try to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100, with hints for incorrect attempts.
   📌 Key concepts: `random number generation`, `while loops`, `conditional logic`, `user input handling`, `attempt counter`.

9. **Hangman game**  
   A Java program that implements the classic hangman game. The player must guess the secret word by typing letters. With each incorrect attempt, the number of remaining attempts decreases. The game ends when the word is discovered or when the attempts run out.
   📌 Key concepts: `arrays`, `loops`, `conditional logic`, `user input (Scanner)`, `flow control with boolean`.


## 🔄 Development process

1. **Initial implementation**: Code created based on the content learned.
2. **Review and corrections**: Post-implementation analysis for improvements and adjustments.
